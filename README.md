* To run this project, use the command in the terminal of this directory:
```bash
python3 main.py -<arg>
```

Where arg is one of the following:
* `f` for using the Feed Forward Neural Network
* `r` for using the Recurrent Neural Network  

So, For running the Feed Forward Neural Network, use the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py -f
```

And for running the Recurrent Neural Network, use the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py -r
```

The code will then prompt you to enter a sentence of your choice and then it will predict the POS tags for the words in the sentence.
